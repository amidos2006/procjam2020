I hate you like a bad paper because
You disgust me as much as unclean math equations because
You repulse me like two magnets of the opposite direction because
I can't be seen with you like a paper in low tier conference because
You are sloppy researcher
These papers are as sloppy as your face
Your face is like a paper from a low tier conference
I feel disgusted by you because
